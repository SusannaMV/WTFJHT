1/ **Federal investigators have sought the cooperation of Paul Manafort’s son-in-law** in an effort to gain leverage over Trump’s former campaign chairman and turn him into a cooperating witness. Jeffrey Yohai, who hasn't been accused of wrongdoing, is a business partner with Manafort and it's unclear if investigators have secured cooperation from Yohai. Manafort is a focus in the investigations into Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential campaign. He and Yohai are also under investigation for business and real estate transactions.

2/ **Special counsel Robert Mueller subpoenaed Manafort's bank records**. The subpoenas were sent in recent weeks from a Washington grand jury to global banks for account information and records of transactions involving Manafort and some of his companies.

3/ **Trump's lawyer called the FBI raid on Manafort's home a “gross abuse of the judicial process”** for the sake of “shock value." John Dowd also questioned the validity of the search warrant, calling it an “extraordinary invasion of privacy.” ([Fox News](http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/08/10/trump-lawyer-slams-special-counsel-for-gross-abuse-in-manafort-raid-challenges-warrant.html))

4/ **The White House has failed to coordinate with a coalition of Latino organizations to develop Affordable Care Act outreach campaigns** ahead of the open enrollment period, which begins on November 1st. Since 2013, the Department of Health and Human Services and the White House have helped develop education campaigns aimed at helping millions of Latinos sign up for health insurance. Trump has repeatedly announced his intention to “let Obamacare implode." ([Talking Points Memo](http://talkingpointsmemo.com/dc/trump-hhs-abandons-latino-outreach-on-obamacare))

5/ **A nonpartisan study found that Trump's own actions have triggered health care premium increases**. Trump's mixed signals have created uncertainty “far outside the norm,” which is leading to double-digit premium increases on individual health insurance policies purchased by many consumers. 15 of the 20 major metropolitan areas will see increases of 10% or more next year.

6/ **Key posts across the executive branch are still empty**, because the Trump administration has yet to nominate anyone – including several pivotal to relations with North Korea. ([CNN](http://www.cnn.com/2017/08/10/politics/north-korea-trump-nominations-vacancies/index.html))

poll/ **70% of Americans believe Trump's finances are fair game** in the federal investigation into Russia's efforts to influence the 2016 presidential election. ([CNN](http://www.cnn.com/2017/08/10/politics/cnn-poll-russia-investigation-trump-finances/))

poll/ **Nearly half of Republicans say they would support postponing the 2020 presidential election if Trump proposed it** in order to fix what they believe to be large-scale voter fraud. Claims that 3 to 5 million “illegals” voted in the election are not true, but that hasn't stopped a substantial number of Republicans from believing the rumors.
