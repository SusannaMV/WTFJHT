1/ **Trump's now deputy chief of staff received an email in June 2016 from a person attempting to set up a meeting with Putin**. The email occurred around the time that Trump Jr., Jared Kushner, and Paul Manafort met with the Russian lawyer at Trump Tower. At the time, Rick Dearborn served as Jeff Sessions' chief of staff. Investigators want to know if Dearborn played a role in arranging the two meetings that occurred between the then-Russian ambassador to the US, Sergey Kislyak, and Sessions.

2/ **Kislyak downplayed his contact with the Trump campaign**, calling allegations that he tried to recruit people within Trump's orbit as spies "nonsense." Kislyak is considered to be one of Russia's top spies and spy-recruiters in Washington. He left the US for Russia last month after concluding his tour of service.

3/ **The private investigator behind the infamous Trump dossier spent almost 10 hours behind closed doors with the Senate Judiciary Committee**. Glenn Simpson, who cofounded the private research firm Fusion GPS, answered questions about the 35-page document. Fusion GPS hired a former British intelligence officer, Christopher Steele, to compile the dossier, which alleges that Trump had a long-running relationship with Russia and that the Kremlin holds compromising material on him. 

Fusion GPS was initially hired by Republicans and later Democrats to explore then-candidate Trump’s past. Simpson did not reveal who paid for the research, but Fusion GPS said it remains “proud” of the work and “stands by it.”

Simpson is the first of three major players to speak with judiciary staff in the ongoing Russia probe. Trump Jr. and Paul Manafort both cut deals to speak with committee staff in private, but their dates have not been scheduled yet.

4/ **The White House set guidelines for implementing Trump's ban on transgender people in the military**. The policy will give Defense Secretary Jim Mattis authority to expel transgender people from the military. The memo also directs the Pentagon to stop recruiting transgender troops and to stop paying for sexual reassignment surgery and other medical treatments for those already serving. Mattis has six months to prepare to fully implement the ban.
