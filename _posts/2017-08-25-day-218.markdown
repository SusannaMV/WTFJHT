1/ **Trump’s top economic adviser said the White House “must do better in consistently and unequivocally” condemning hate groups**. Gary Cohn, a prominent Jewish member of Trump’s administration, drafted a letter of resignation after Trump defended the white nationalist protesters in Charlottesville. Cohn’s remarks were in contrast to those of Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, [who defended Trump](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/20/us/politics/steven-mnuchin-trump-reaction-to-charlottesville-violence.html). Mnuchin is also Jewish.

2/ **CIA Director Mike Pompeo has required that the unit investigating possible collusion between Russia and the Trump campaign report directly to him**. Pompeo, who spends more time at the White House than his predecessors, has repeatedly played down Russia’s interference in the 2016 election. Officials in the CIA counterintelligence unit say they have to “watch” Pompeo over fear he might report new information directly to Trump. The worry among some at the agency is “that if you were passing on something too dicey \[to Pompeo\] he would go to the White House with it.” ([Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/at-cia-a-watchful-eye-on-mike-pompeo-the-presidents-ardent-ally/2017/08/24/18c1d716-7ed0-11e7-9d08-b79f191668ed_story.html))

3/ **The former British spy who put together the dossier of allegations about Trump during last year’s campaign has been ordered to give a deposition** in a libel case brought against BuzzFeed News, which published the document. Christopher Steele authored the 35-page dossier while working for Fusion GPS and its founder Glenn Simpson. The document was crafted as opposition research for unknown political rivals of Trump. None of the claims have been corroborated. Steele will now be questioned under oath about his role in producing the dossier.

4/ **Trump is considering ending DACA**, the Obama-era policy that shields some illegal immigrants from deportation. Jeff Sessions strongly believes Trump should end DACA, which would affect at least 750,000 people. Trump’s aides have recently [pushed him to protect young children](https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/2017/08/22/day-215/#4-trump’s-aides-are-pushing-him-to-p) brought to the US illegally, despite his campaign promise to deport so-called Dreamers.
